            <h2>Understanding “Can” and “Can’t”</h2>
            <p>
                In English, the modal verb <strong>can</strong> is used to talk about
                <strong>abilities</strong>, <strong>possibilities</strong>, and
                <strong>permissions</strong>.  
                Its negative form is <strong>can’t</strong> (contraction of <em>cannot</em>) and it is used to express
                <strong>inability</strong>, <strong>impossibility</strong>, or <strong>prohibition</strong>.
            </p>

            <h3>Structure</h3>
            <p>
                The grammatical structure with <strong>can</strong> and <strong>can’t</strong> is very simple:
            </p>
            <pre> Subject + can/can’t + base verb + complement </pre>
            <p><em>Examples:</em></p>
            <ul>
                <li>I can swim. → I am able to swim.</li>
                <li>She can’t drive. → She is not able to drive.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Uses of “Can”</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ability:</strong> I can play the piano. (I know how to play the piano)</li>
                <li><strong>Possibility:</strong> We can go to the park tomorrow. (It is possible for us to go to the park tomorrow)</li>
                <li><strong>Permission:</strong> You can use my phone. (You are allowed to use my phone)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Uses of “Can’t”</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Inability:</strong> I can’t speak Japanese. (I am not able to speak Japanese)</li>
                <li><strong>Impossibility:</strong> Pigs can’t fly. (It’s impossible for pigs to fly)</li>
                <li><strong>Prohibition:</strong> You can’t park here. (It’s not allowed to park here)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Questions with “Can”</h3>
            <p>
                To make questions, the order of the subject and the modal verb is inverted:
            </p>
            <pre> Can + subject + base verb + complement? </pre>
            <ul>
                <li>Can you dance? → Are you able to dance?</li>
                <li>Can he drive a car? → Is he able to drive a car?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The most common short answers are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Yes, I can.</li>
                <li>No, I can’t.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                In summary, <strong>can</strong> and <strong>can’t</strong> are used with the base form of the verb (without “to”) and they do not change with the subject.  
                Example:  
                <em>I can run</em> | <em>He can run</em> | <em>They can run</em>
            </p>
